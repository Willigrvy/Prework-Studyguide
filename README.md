# Bootcamp Studyguide

## Description

This project is a simple test. It is my baby step into the world of programming. Being blatantly honest I am not a very good student and this project has made me realize a lot of my faults that I have. That said the goal is simply to learn basic programming that i will build upon in my bootcamp classes.

## Usage

This studyguide is not really meant to be looked back on by myself(hopefully.) It's purpose was to teach me what goes into creating a basic webpage and all the horrifically complicated steps it takes to accomplish a minor task. It was very sucessful in that endeavor. Now this studyguide will serve as a reminder of the day I decided to go down this path. and I filled it with notes to so maybe I can look at those while I'm here.
